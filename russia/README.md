# Russia node

This folder is the public radio node for the Yandex Cloud VM.

Role:
- serves the website, player, admin panel, Telegram bot, and `/stream`;
- keeps the same Node/Docker project logic as the original app;
- stores local music under `app/music`;
- calls ElevenLabs through the private EU tunnel using `ELEVENLABS_BASE_URL=http://10.77.0.1:18080`;
- calls Telegram Bot API through the private EU tunnel using `TELEGRAM_API_BASE_URL=http://10.77.0.1:18081`.

Current test URL:

```text
http://111.88.144.171/
http://111.88.144.171/admin.html
http://111.88.144.171/stream
```

When the domain is ready, point `radio.ryudzaki.website` to `111.88.144.171` with DNS-only mode.

Layout:

```text
app/      full radio application copy for the Russia node
scripts/  helper scripts for Yandex deployment and checks
```

Do not commit `app/.env` or real audio files unless you intentionally want them in GitHub.
